## Motivation
During the course TDT4160 at NTNU. There are exercises to write assembly code for a RISC-V processor.
I wanted to run this on an actual RISC-V processor instead of on a simulator.


This project has a lot of inspiration from a [course](https://vhdlwhiz.com/product/course-risc-v-processor-hello-world-in-vhdl/) by [VHDLWhiz](https://vhdlwhiz.com/) on creating a RISC-V processor.

## Further improvement
It would be interesting to improve on the processor to eventually be able to run DOOM.
